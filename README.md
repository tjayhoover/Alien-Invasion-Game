# Alien-Invasion-Game

The code for this Alien Invasion game comes courtesy of Python Crash Course, A Hands on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming, by Eric Matthes.

I worked on this Alien Invasion game for a class project in my introductory programming course during my first semester in college.
The code is not my original work; most of it comes from the book listed above.

However, walking through this project step-by-step gave me a better understanding of how Python works, and how projects are structured.
